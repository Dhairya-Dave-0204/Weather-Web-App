<b>Weather Web App</b>

Welcome to the Weather Web App project! üå§Ô∏è This is a simple and fun app that lets you find out the weather in any place you want. Just type in the name of the place, and it will show you if it‚Äôs sunny, rainy, or cloudy. It‚Äôs like having your very own weather station on your computer!

<b>How It Works</b>

Here‚Äôs how the Weather Web App works:

Search Field: There is a little box where you can type in the name of a place. This could be your city, your friend‚Äôs city, or even a place you dream of visiting one day!

Weather Display: After you type in the place and hit the search button, the app will show you the weather. You‚Äôll see things like the temperature (how hot or cold it is), if it‚Äôs sunny, rainy, or cloudy, and even some extra details like the wind speed.

Behind the Scenes: The app is built using three cool technologies:

HTML: This is like the building blocks of our app. It creates the structure, kind of like how LEGO bricks build a house.
CSS: This is the paint and decorations. It makes our app look nice and colorful.
JavaScript: This is the magic part! It makes the app smart so it can talk to the weather service and get the information you need.

<b>The OpenWeather API </b>
To find out the weather, our app talks to a special service called a OpenWeather API. An API is like a helper that knows a lot about the weather. Our app asks the API for the weather in the place you typed, and the API sends back the information. The best part is, this API is free to use, so everyone can enjoy it!

<b>Features</b>
- Easy to Use: Just type in a place and see the weather. It‚Äôs that simple!
